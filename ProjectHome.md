The provable data possession (PDP) library allows a client that has stored data at an untrusted server to verify that the server possesses the original data without retrieving it or storing a copy himself.  It accomplishes this by generating probabilistic proofs of possession by sampling random sets of blocks from the server.

PDP uses homomorphic verifiable tags to minimize the amount of server computation, network traffic and block accesses while achieving a strong guarantee of data possession.
